						<p>I would like to welcome and thank everyone who is reading this, welcome to the news of Wandermere. Here I, Olmare Coinbrew, will be showing you around and telling you about the wonders of the beautiful City of Wandermere. Since you are going to be hearing quite a bit from me, I wanted to write this first blog to introduce myself to you all. I want you all to know who is writing your news.</p>
						<p>To repeat, I am Olmare Coinbrew, I am a rather young dwarf, 50 years old, and I am doing an apprenticeship with the town scribe. My parents taught me to read and write, so I am already ahead of the game.</p>
						<p>I love to write about the events going on around the town and whatever else I can find that seems interesting. For now, I think that is enough about me, if you would like to hear more about me, just let me know. Almost all of the other blogs from here on out are going to be me telling you about things happening in the city.</p>
						<p>I will see you all later!! Stay on the lookout for my next Article!</p>

						<p>Have you all heard of the shadow beast. there was something spotted Sunday night on the outer edge of the city wall, it appeared to look like a shadow monster. It has legs and tentacles coming from its back and it stood on two legs, the tentacles seem to made from shadows. Allegedly, there have been reports of missing children in different wards of Wandermere, could this new beast be the cause of all of this ruckus? Where did this beast come from, people have said it lives in the woods to the north of the city. If it is taking the children, what is it doing with them? All of their life monitors are reporting them as living. Is the shadow beast taking the children or is there more to this story?</p>
						<p>This coming Thursday night there will be a group of City Guard that will go with a small squadron of Soldiers to see what is happening in the woods, maybe they can find an answer to where these children have gone, maybe they will be able to find an answer as to what this shadow beast really is? Is it made of shadows? Is this the creation from someone's nightmare or does this come from something else?</p>
						<p>Stayed tuned next time to see what is happening in Wandermere!</p>

						<p>This post is a rather interesting one. There are more strange things happening in Wandermere on this week. As I informed you all last week there was going to be a group sent out to check the woods. Well, the group has not returned yet, but their stay was extended by a week or unless they have found something. The guards found interesting tracks leading further into the woods. They also found the children they were all accounted for and found in a tent deep in the forest. Now the strange thing with the children is that when they were found, the guards found weird markings on the children, it looked as if there were ancient runes painted on their skin, the lab is still trying to figure out what the substance is, and they are also working on translating the runic language.</p>
						<p>Now, it is time to talk about the Great War. As almost all of you know we have been in a raging war for the last several years due to the festival incident almost 10 years ago, but there is something else that has come up. The Kingdom of Zarius we have been fighting the war with seems to have fallen ill and lost half numbers due to an unknown virus. With that being said, it looks like the northern kingdoms will be winning the war soon, meaning we will be able to stop all of the fighting and resume regular life again. </p>
						<p>Well, that's all I have for you now! Come back later to see more news.</p>
