				<h4>Information about Place</h4>
				<p>There is only one guard tower in the city, and it stands at the very center It is actually in the center of the palace and it guards all of the city. The guard tower is more of a watch tower. Mages	sit at the very top of the tower and watch the city very closely. When an alarm is raised, they are sent down to fix and look at things. The guard tower warns the city wall of what is happening and from there guard can be sent out.</p>
				<p>The tower itself is one of the tallest buildings in the city, it is very distinguished and noticeable from anywhere in the city. The Tower will always stand guard over the city, the first line of response from the tower is to send golems out from the tower and the wall so that everything is protected, until the proper people arrive there to help the situation.</p>
