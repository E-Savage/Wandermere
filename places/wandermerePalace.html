				<h4>Information about Place</h4>
				<p>The palace of Wandermere was built over 2000 years ago by the first mages to unite under one kingdom. The palace stands as a symbol of the people united under one crown. The palace was built out of magistaline: a lovely purplish material with a shine to it. The material is known as magistaline, it forms when any type of crystal has been exposed to strong magic. The palace has always been a place where the people of the city could come and socialize. Wandermere palace is a place where science thrives, and the people yearn to be as knowledgeable as possible. The Royal Academy is even held inside the palace. </p>
				<p>But there is a dark secret hiding somewhere within the palace, one that has been rumored for centuries since the formation of the city. It was said by the elders of the city that the first king of Iglucia was a mage gifted with powerful blood magic. His blood magic was used to help power the city in ways that no-one else understands, except maybe the elders. The old stories say that the first king is locked under the palace and forced to fuel the city with his dark magic.</p>
