				<h3>Information about Place</h3>
				<p>The City Hall of Wandermere is in the middle of the city, near the palace, it serves as the home to the City Council. Council meetings happen here, and the laws were written here during Council meetings. It also serves as the courthouse for the city. Most records about the city are also kept here but there are other copies of the documents stored elsewhere for safe keeping. City Hall does work to help the citizens and now it stands there in the city to serve the city. Something is always happening or being decided at the City Hall.</p>
