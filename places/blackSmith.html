				<h3>Information about Black Smith</h3>
				<p>In Wandermere there is only currently one black smith, even though there is only one black smith, the operation is huge. The size of the building allows for hundreds of workers to work and create things. They make weapons and armor such as swords, shields, armor, wands, and staffs. There is a possibility for all of these items to have different enchantments. The weapons and armor that comes from this shop are top tier, they are some of the best products that come out of Wandermere.</p>
				<p>The black smiths of Wandermere forged great weapons, such as the Eldritch Blade. The Eldritch blade is a blade that stores eldritch energy in the sword and when ready the wielder can press a button to release energy making their attack stronger. But there is only so much energy that the sword can hold at once, but if that supply is drained one may channel their own magic into the sword and make their attacks more powerful that way, but it is at the price of their own life force.</p>
				<p>Another weapon to come from the black smith is the necro-wand, this is an ancient wand that has been locked away for the dangers it has caused. The wand amplifies the users magic but at a price. The wand amplifies magic of the user but in return in drains life from other living things, it can be the life of the user or the life of others, the wand will take its price for being used. There have been lots of times where a mage has cleared a battlefield just trying to charge up the wand.</p>
