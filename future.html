				<h4>My thoughts about the Project</h4>
				<p>This setting will be used in a game at some point that I am making for a senior honors project. I might also use this setting for a Dungeons and Dragons campaign. There are stories and games that this setting can be used to make.</p>
				<p>I think this setting will be very rich and full of material that can be used for people to use in their own creative projects. I will allow the use of material here for the other people to use but whatever is posted to this website by me is what is considered to be canon.</p>
				<p>My project is here to help those who may be a little lost in their own project and do not know where to go next. But that is the purpose of this website, while I work on my own projects from this setting, I am creating others can use this material to make their own worlds. </p>
				<p>I want to help people in their own creative endeavors, and I feel that this is the best way to do it. My fellow writers, I wish you all the best with your own creative writings!</p>
