				<h3>City Council</h3>
				<p>The city Council consists of all the Heads of the Famous houses and other members. The main players are Walo, Magia, Cetio, and Ocwulf. Another member on the council is Murdaigen McGuinness, he serves as the main non-magi representative. Keldi also serves on the council. The King and Queen attend the meetings to hear what is going on in the world today and to help solve daily problems. They decide how the kingdom will respond to certain things and what should be taken to the King. For the most part the Council handles the important things, with the king as it its head, there are many things that are discussed relating to how the kingdom will function and how the kingdom will proceed on certain matters. </p>
				<p>It should be noted the King or Queen may start whatever they want but the council must also go through the king unless all main members have decided to go the same way. This is important because the council usually should not act without the King and vice versa.</p>
