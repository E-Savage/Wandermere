				<h3>Magi Syndacite</h3>
				<p>The magi syndicate is the organization that takes care of everything about Magic. It creates all laws and regulations that regards the use of magic. All citizens get to vote for all laws on magic this is overseen by the city council to be as fair as possible. Allowing all citizens have a say allows for non-magic users to feel safer and more empowered but it also allows magic users to still use their magic in daily life situations.</p>
