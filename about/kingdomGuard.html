				<h3>Kingdom's Guard</h3>
				<p>The kingdom's guard is one of the noblest band of knights in the kingdom. The Kingdom's guard handles protecting the Kingdom from all threats. They are the first group to respond to all threats and they hold more power than the other types of guard.</p>
				<p>For someone to become a knight in the Kingdom's Guard it takes a large amount of training. One must go through the regular process of becoming a knight. But, in this case they must have served in the army for at least 5 years on the frontline. Sometimes, for healers this could be different. Sometimes there are actually Illusionists and enchanters that are selected to become part of the Kingdom's Guard. There are two main divisions in the kingdom's guard are the city guard and the order of the king. </p>
				<p>They are always looking for new recruits, but do you have what it takes? Do you think you can qualify?</p>
				<h4>City Guard</h4>
				<p>This division of knights Guards the city and serves as a quick deploy militia for anything going on in the city. They work to help the townspeople as well, when there is nothing going on they will help the people of the town.</p>
				<h4>Order of the King</h4>
				<p>The order of the king is the section of knights that specifically guard the king and their family. They are also charged with guarding the castle and anyone in it at that time. Each family member of the king has a small team of knights assigned to them at all times.</p>
