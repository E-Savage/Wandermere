				<h3>The Introduction</h3>
				<p>Wandermere is a sword and sorcerer world. It is going to become a highly developed world with lots of different things
				in it. I plan on using this for a game I plan on designing. The world will feature characters and many wondrous places.</p>
				
				<h3>My Thoughts behind Wandermere</h3>
				<p>As I said above Wandermere is one of my creative porjects, but I am also going to use it as the setting for another project.
				</p>
				
				<p>I started the Wandermere project because I like to world build and I haver never built a world to completion before. Wandermere
				on the other hand is different. I am really liking how the process is going with this project and I am excited about it. I like what
				I have done so far and I am excited to see where it leads me.</p>
				
				<p>In the past I have come up with world ideas but have never actually ran with them like I have with this one, I have also liked to write
				stories and this project is helping get back into. Sometimes it is hard to make content but in the end the struggle helps to make it better</p>
				
				<p><b>Before you continue exploring my site I would like to thank you for taking the time to look at my project! </b></p>
