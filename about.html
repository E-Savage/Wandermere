				<h3>What is Wandermere?</h3>
				<p>Wandermere is a sword and sorcery fantasy city that is going to become the setting for a bigger project that I am working on. I plan on making a game senior honors project that will feature the city of Wandermere as its setting.</p>
				<h3>Where is Wandermere located?</h3>
				<p>Wandermere is located in the world of Iglucia, which is a world that I have started making as a creative project. I have been working on this world for about  2 months. Originally, it started as a campaign setting for Dungeons and Dragons, but I decided to scrap that project and I have decided that this is how I will be using the world.</p>
				<h3>Why is it important?</h3>
				<p>Wandermere is important to me because it is a fairly large creative endeavor that I am pursuing. When you make something, it is very dear and near to you, this is the same for me and this project. Now, to make it important for you as an audience to find it interesting. I have to find a way to make it easy for you all to invest yourselves in this world. I want to make the world life like, and I want it to seem like these people are real. They need to be believable; they can be outrageous but in a believable way.</p>
				<h3>About the Creator</h3>
				<p>So, my name is Eric Savage, and I am a 4th year computer science, and I will be graduating in May 2023. I am making this world because I like to make things, I have always played with Legos, played Minecraft (and other sandbox games), and now I try to program things on the computer. I have liked to write, especially when I was younger, my favorite assignments were creative writing assignments. </p>
				<p>With, this project is something that I am holding close to myself as a personal project, and I plan on spending a lot of time working on it. I would hope that you all like it and if you would like to say something about the project or give your own suggestions you can shoot me an email. I will include my email and my GitHub at the bottom of this page for anyone who would like to contact me or look at my other projects.</p>
